# goPos_task

Auth2.0 + Retrofit + ObjectBox + lifecycle awareness

Not every possible data is displayed. Only "readable" - meaning Ids of category etc is being saved but not displayed.
View is handled by RecyclerView which is lifecycle aware - meaning rotating phone doesn't affect data in it
UI for sure would need a proper enhancement
